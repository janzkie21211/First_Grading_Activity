        Step By Step HOW TO COOK LECHE FLAN? The traditional way to cook leche flan is to steam it using a steamer. But nowadays, it is also common to bake it in the oven using bain-marie or a water bath. Rice cooker can also be used as a steamer.

            First, you have to make the caramelized sugar. Simply add sugar to the llaneras and cook it over medium heat until it melts into a texture similar to molten-lava. Let it cool down and set.

    <h4>THE SECRET TO A CREAMY AND SMOOTH LECHE FLAN</h4>
    <p>
        I will let you in a secret I learned to have a perfectly smooth and bubble-free Leche Flan like this one.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            his Leche Flan was baked in the oven in a water bath instead of steamed. I got this neat trick from Lalaine's Leche flan recipe of Kawaling Pinoy. I tried it on a batch I did for New Year’s Eve and it worked nicely!
        </li>
        <li>
            Try not to beat too fast to avoid adding air to the egg-milk mixture. This will become bubbles that will form holes in the custard once cooked. Tap the llanera on the counter several times before cooking to release trapped bubbles.
        </li>
        <li>
            When making the caramel, make sure that all the sugar has completely melted and not gritty. It should look like dark honey without any granules left. If not, this will leave marks on the sides of the flan as the caramel starts to melt when steamed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try not to burn the sugar when doing the caramel. Burnt sugar will give the Leche Flan a bitter taste.
        </li>
        <li>You can add a bit of water to the sugar to melt it faster.</li>
        <li>
            Do not separate the egg whites and yolks too early. Exposing the egg yolks to the air will allow it to create a skin. This will become lumps that are difficult to melt.
        </li>
    </ul>
