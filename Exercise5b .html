            Hey guys! I‚Äôm digging back into the blog archives today to share one of my all-time favorite recipes with you again. And I really do mean all-time. Because fried rice and I go wayyyy back. ‚ô° Like specifically, back to my picky-eating days that lasted
            ‚Äî oh ‚Äî until college, when I was totally ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù who refused to even look at anything else on the menu at a Chinese restaurant besides fried rice and my trusty egg drop soup. Guys, I was crazy about my fried rice. And this was thanks in
            large part to our amazing little neighborhood Chinese restaurant that knew how to fry up a mean batch of rice, and set the bar high for what I expected fried rice to be. I mean, back then, I just assumed that all fried rice was perfectly stir-fried
            and full of big flavors and irresistibly delicious! Little did I know about the painfully bland, boring, and tasteless stuff that I would encounter at too many other Chinese restaurants once I ventured out of the nest. Even today, I still
            can‚Äôt believe it when I stumble across a bad batch. Such a missed opportunity! Anyway, I figured out pretty quickly once I left for college (in a small town with zero good fried rice) that this was a problem I was going to have to remedy in
            my own kitchen. So over many years and literally dozens of test batches, I finally landed on my favorite recipe back in 2014 that has been my go-to ever since. It‚Äôs surprisingly speedy to make, easy to customize with your favorite add-ins,
            and more flavorful and amazing than any take-out I‚Äôve ever ordered. And it‚Äôs all thanks to a few simple tips that hundreds of readers have agreed totally work. Let‚Äôs make some homemade fried rice!

    <h4>Step By Step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use cold rice</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/images.jpeg" alt="EGG" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            You‚Äôve gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy and sticky clumps ‚Äî no good. So leftover refrigerated rice is ideal! Or,
            if you are in a hurry (or have an impulse craving for fried rice, which I completely understand üòâ), just cook up a fresh batch of rice. Then spread it out on a baking sheet or another large flat pan, drape the rice with a layer of plastic
            wrap, then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10-15 minutes) until it is thoroughly chilled (not frozen).
        </p>
        <li>Use butter</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/Butter-Fried-Rice-Fuss-Free-Cooking-8.jpg" alt="butter" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            Yes, butter. I have made many a batch of fried rice using various oils, and I‚Äôm now convinced there‚Äôs a reason why Japanese steak houses use that big ol‚Äô slab of butter when they‚Äôre making fried rice. It just tastes so much better, and also makes everything
            brown up perfectly. (Although don‚Äôt be scared ‚Äî we only use 3 tablespoons for a very large batch of rice!)
        </p>
        <li>Use veggies</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/veggie-fried-rice-12.jpg" alt="soy" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            This is one of my big pet peeves with lame take-out fried rice ‚Äî not enough veggies! In addition to adding some nice spots of color, veggies go a long way in adding some flavor and freshness to fried rice. Our local Chinese restaurant always added both
            white and green onions, too, which I included in this recipe. But feel free to modernize this recipe with some other delicious stir-fried veggies as well!
        </p>
        <li>Use toasted sesame oil and oyster sauce</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/download.jpeg" alt="EGG" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            If you do not eat seafood, you can leave out the oyster sauce and your fried rice will still be great. But this ingredient makes such a difference in good fried rice, and a little goes a long way. So even if you‚Äôre not into oysters, don‚Äôt be scared of
            oyster sauce! Toasted sesame oil, on the other hand, is 100% non-negotiable. It is my favorite smelling ingredient in my kitchen, and tastes wonderful in fried rice. (Also note that sesame oil is meant as a finishing oil, not a cooking oil,
            so remove the pan from the heat and then stir it in.)
        </p>
        <li>Use high heat</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/181120-wok-full.gif" alt="EGG" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            This will help fry and brown the rice and veggies well, and will also help prevent the rice from steaming in the pan instead of frying.
        </p>
        <li>Let the rice brown a bit on the bottom</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/download (1).jpeg" alt="EGG" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            If you‚Äôre like me and love your rice to be a bit crispy, let it rest for a bit in between stirs so that it can brown a bit on the bottom. It also helps greatly to use a non-stick skillet so that the rice doesn‚Äôt stick to the bottom of the pan.
        </p>
        <li>Don‚Äôt be afraid to add in some extra soy sauce at the end</li>
        <img src="Fried Rice Img/szechuan-beef-2.jpg" alt="EGG" width="200" height="150" />
        <p>
            I know that everyone has different sensitivities to salt, and different brands of soy sauce also contain pretty dramatically different levels of sodium. So I went a little light on soy sauce in the recipe below. But please add more at the end if this
            tastes good to you. I almost always stir an extra drizzle into my portion and love it.
